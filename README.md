This is a repository to keep track of my amfoss tasks.
# task-0 . Install Ubuntu 18.04
  ## Step 1 : Allocating free space of the Hard drive for the computer .-
               1.  Open disk management in computer 
               2.  un-allocate around 100 GB for Ubuntu OS and files 
  ## Step 2:  Downloading the Ubuntu 18.04 .ISO file from the official site 
               1.  https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop ( NOTE: this is only for PC)
                                  use this link . Will be 1.9 GB or so .
  ## Step 3:  Download Rufus: (to make the .ISO file directly portable via USB)(Pen Drive required)
               1. https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.6/rufus-3.6.exe
                                    this is link for Rufus .
               2.  Open Rufus:
                                    select the downloaded .ISO  file .
                                    Select the USB drive as Device 
                                    Select partition scheme as FAT 32 
                                    Click on Start 
                                    once its done , you're USB is ready to be directly booted with Ubuntu 
   ## Step 4: Restart your PC 
                 Normally some PC's might show the boot loader directly but if it doesn't show , google what your model or make's bios key ,it will mostly be F11,F12.<br/>
                 Then click on Boot via USB 
                 click on install Ubuntu 
   ## Step 5:Go through the installation
                 go through the installation , do not forget to click on the dual boot option rather than single drive installation option.
                 after completing the installation , you can remove the USB and reboot , now you'll see the GRUB Boot loader there you can select either you want to boot to Ubuntu or the OS you were using earlier .
## ERRORS YOU MIGHT GET:
1.The most common error is that while doing Step 4 your PC's might continue to boot to the same Operating system used earlier 

 FIX: Google youre systems make and model for bios key (mostly it eill be f9, f10, or esc)
 
 
2. Other errors people do is that they click on wipe drive and install Ubuntu rather than install Ubuntu alongside Windows

 FIX: For dual boot Star all the amFOSS repositoriesing click on "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows"
 
3.PC not booting after restarting for first time :

 FIX:this occurs when the boot properties are set to USB first rather than hard drive , you could remove the hard drive you've forgot to      remove or you can change youre boot sequence by entering the BIOS and putting the Hard drive in the first .
 # test 1- Star all the amFOSS repositories
 I used this [link](https://github.com/amfoss/star-me) and followed the steps from that website .
 NOTE: Google Chrome is required 
 After starring everything the scren will look something like  [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J_9AtG7wUbjaAoq81PfyN_KkbbDFT1b2/view?usp=sharing).
